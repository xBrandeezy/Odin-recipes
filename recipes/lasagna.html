 <h1>Vegetarian Mexican Lasagna</h1>

<h4>A vegetarian Tex-Mex lasagna made with corn tortillas and packed with cheese and veggies. Garnished with cilantro, sour cream, and other favorite toppings.</h4>
<p>This dish was a hit with the whole family. Followed recipe exactly, other than adding a little extra spinach since we love it. The ratio of veggies and cheese and corn tortillas is <br> perfect ! The enchilada sauce and salsa you use can vary the flavors to your liking, which is perfect. I used green enchilada sauce, next time I will try using red.</p>
